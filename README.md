# US-COVID-19 Statistics State Comparison
This is part 2 of my Capstone for the University of Colorado Boulder's Data Analysis with Tidyverse Certificate.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which had a devastating impact on global health, economies, and societies. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 20th, 2020. WHO then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 although initial cases were reported in Wuhan, China in December of 2019.  

Countries around the world implemented lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mask mandates to slow the transmission of the virus. However, many countries have since lifted those restrictions as cases and deaths have declined. This is thanks to the development of vaccines and antiviral medications targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 

In this project I build off of the first part of this project and compare the COVID-19 cases and deaths statistics across states within the US.
